---   We've created a database of a few popular authors and their books, with word counts for each book. In this first step, select all the authors who
     have written more than 1 million words, using GROUP BY and HAVING. Your results table should include the 'author' and their total word count as a 'total_words' column.
 
*/Select author, sum(words) as total_words from books group by author having total_words > 1000000;

---Now select all the authors that write more than an average of 150,000 words per book. Your results table should include the 'author' and average words as an 'avg_words' column.

Select author, avg(words) as avg_words from books group by author having avg_words > 150000;


---Calculating results with CASE

*/We've created a database to track student grades, with their name, number grade, and what percent of activities they've completed. In this first step, select all of the rows, 
and display the name, number_grade, and percent_completed, which you can compute by multiplying and rounding the fraction_completed column.

select  name, number_grade, round(fraction_completed *100) as  percent_completed from student_grades;

*/Now, this step is a little tricky. The goal is a table that shows how many students have earned which letter_grade. You can output the letter_grade by using CASE 
with the number_grade column, outputting 'A' for grades > 90, 'B' for grades > 80, 'C' for grades > 70, and 'F' otherwise. Then you can use COUNT with GROUP BY to show the 
number of students with each of those grades.

select  count(*)
    CASE
    when number_grade > 90 then 'A'
    when number_grade > 80 then 'B'
    when number_grade > 70 then 'C'
    else 'F'
    END as letter_grade 
from student_grades group by letter_grade;
